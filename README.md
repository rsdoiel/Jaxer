# Jaxer - the JavaScript server

## summary

This was one approach to server side JavaScript. Others were based around Rhino JS engine. I forked this repo mostly to try to remember Jaxer's APIs and remember how they compared with early NodeJS.

## why the fork?

I forked this from [Aptana/Jaxer](https://github.com/aptana/jaxer) for historical interests. Before NodeJS there were many different attempts to use JavaScript server side. The first I remember was Netscape's own server. Later I remember a project called Naurwal using the Java Rhino JS engine.  Neither caught on. I remember when Jaxer arrived it looked promising. It fit nicely in the LAMP stack. Ultimately I don't remember meeting anyone who adapted it (though I remember buzz and interest at conferences). It was a nice idea but if you were already in a PHP, Python or Ruby shop the story just wasn't compelling enough.  A while later NodeJS showed up and the whole thinking about JavaScript server side changed.

There is a little bit around on the web if you search enough. As of 2016-02-13 IBM developer works still has the article [Build Ajax applications using the first real Ajax server: Aptana Jaxer](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/wa-aj-jaxer/).  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aptana#Aptana_Jaxer) has an entry for the high level view of Aptana (the company behind Jaxer) and what happened to them.
