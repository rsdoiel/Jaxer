# Jaxer
The JavaScript Server

See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aptana#Aptana_Jaxer) for details about Jaxer and Aptana.
This was one approach to server side JavaScript. Others were based around Rhino JS engine. I forked 
this repo mostly to try to remember Jaxer's APIs and remember how they compared with early NodeJS.
